# Flower-Pollination-Algorithm
In this repo, I  implemented FPA to multiple problem.
First is to find a root of a function. Using Numerical analysis, for example newton. The method has disadvantage like defining the starting value (x1) and the derivative of a function. 
Second is to find the coefficient of MLR using FPA.
